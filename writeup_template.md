## Traffic Sign Recognition 

#### Overview

The traffic sign project is about building a model based on the convolutional neural network concept in deep learning. Training, Validating and Testing the traffic sign classifier model is based on the German traffic signs dataset. 

#### The Project Steps:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report 

You're reading it! and here is a link to my [project code](https://github.com/AhmedMYassin/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb)

## 1. Data Set Summary & Exploration

1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799 + (34799*2) = 10397 // 34799*2 are generated by input images rotation
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is [32, 32, 3]
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set.

## 2. Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### Preprocessing: 
In this phase we convert the input images to grayscale and apply CLAHE "Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization". The input images are also normalized ((value/255) - 0.5).

#### Augmentation
In this phase, the input images are rotated by 20 and -20 degrees and added to the training set.

| RELU					|												|
| Dropout					|	0.8											|
| Fully Connected     	| input 350, output 43 |	 


### 3. Model Training

To train the model, I used the LeNet model for 10 epochs using 0.0055 learning rate and Adam optimizer instead of gradient descent.

| EPOCH         		|     Validation Accuracy	        					|      Training Accuracy	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| 1	      	| 0.932 				| 0.959 				|
| 2	      	| 0.945 				| 0.978 				|
| 3	      	| 0.955 				| 0.981 				|
| 4	      	| 0.950 				| 0.980 				|
| 5	      	| 0.950 				| 0.982 				|
| 6	      	| 0.951 				| 0.986 				|
| 7	      	| 0.950 				| 0.977 				|
| 8	      	| 0.957 				| 0.988 				|
| 9	      	| 0.948 				| 0.982 				|
| 10	      	| 0.959 				| 0.987 				|

####4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 0.987
* validation set accuracy of 0.959 
* test set accuracy of 0.941

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?
* What were some problems with the initial architecture?
* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.
* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?
* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 

###Test a Model on New Images

####1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

The first image might be difficult to classify because ...

####2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| U-turn     			| U-turn 										|
| Yield					| Yield											|
| 100 km/h	      		| Bumpy Road					 				|
| Slippery Road			| Slippery Road      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 4 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 80%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of ...

####3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|


For the second image ... 

### Visualizing the Neural Network
#### Visualizing the feature maps in the neural network is very helpful. This image is the effect of each of the 22 feature maps on the input image
